#Overview
*This application is the implementation of a simple banking system, using the concepts of **OOP** (Object Orientated Programming)
 Using this concept I was able to create a system  that is able to add,edit and remove clients details. As well this enabled me to pull them in a list*


##Assumptions
*During this project I made a parent class named client, this is would be responsible for distributing all the main variables that will be inherited and passed to the child classes.
I assumed I would only need one parent and child class which were Client and BankApp, this was because the client(jennifer Warrender) stated that a GUI was not needed.
I placed all the variables with in the constructor, therefore, it would not be empty when passing them on to the child class.   
I also assumed that I would make the agreed overdraft limit 100 (`self.overdraft_limit = 100`) 
as a natural number would be more common rather than a **float** in a real life scenario* 
*I also made the overdraft, overdraft limit and balance separate instance variables because I thought it would look better*

###How to run application
*To run the application you would need an IDE, I specifically used pycharm as it was the one I was most comfortable with.
The application would need would be able to run on any of python based IDE as long as it is python 3+*

####Use case
*For `date_of_birth` you would use the format of dd/mm/yyyy, I chose to format as it was the one I was most used too*


#####future reference
I would like to use the methods of hash and eq as
